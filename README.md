## Getting started

Start by [generating a new repository based on this project](https://github.com/riipandi/v60/generate).

After cloning (or downloading) the repository to your local machine, install all dependencies with the command

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Up and running

The project comes with Eleventyâ€™s built-in development server. You can start the server with

```sh
pnpm dev
```

To trigger a production build, use

```sh
pnpm build
```

## Deploy your own

You'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own Next.js website. Once you have an
image generator that sparks joy, you can setup [automatic GitHub](https://vercel.com/github)
deployments so that pushing to master will deploy to production! ðŸš€
